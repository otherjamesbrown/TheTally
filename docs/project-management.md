# Project Management & Next Steps

This document outlines the recommended approach for tracking project progress and next steps in TheTally.

## 🎯 Recommended Pattern: GitHub Issues + Documentation

### 1. **"Next Steps" Issues** (Primary Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Daily checkpoint and session starter
- **Format**: Structured template with current status, priorities, and quick links
- **Lifecycle**: 
  - Create new issue at start of each session
  - Update throughout the session
  - Mark previous session as "✅ COMPLETED" when done

### 2. **Project Board** (Optional)
- **Purpose**: Visual tracking of ongoing work
- **Columns**: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done
- **Usage**: Link issues to track progress

### 3. **Documentation Links** (Reference)
- **Purpose**: Detailed information and processes
- **Files**: 
  - `docs/branching-strategy.md` - Git workflow
  - `docs/development-setup.md` - Development process
  - `docs/deployment.md` - Deployment strategy
  - `SECURITY.md` - Security procedures

## 📋 Next Steps Issue Template

```markdown
## 🎯 Current Status (Updated: [DATE])

### ✅ Completed
- [List completed tasks with links to PRs/commits]

### 🔄 In Progress  
- [List current work with status]

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** [Task description]
2. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** [Task description]  
3. **[LOW PRIORITY]** [Task description]

### 🔮 Future Development
- [List planned future work]

### 🚨 Blockers & Dependencies
- [List any blockers or dependencies]

### 📊 Project Health
- **Security**: [Status - ✅/⚠️/❌]
- **Documentation**: [Status - ✅/⚠️/❌]
- **Branching**: [Status - ✅/⚠️/❌]
- **CI/CD**: [Status - ✅/⚠️/❌]

### 🔗 Quick Links
- [Relevant PRs]
- [Important documentation]
- [Status pages]
- [Previous session issue]
```

## 🚀 Daily Workflow

### Start of Session
1. **Check Previous Session**: Review the last "Next Steps" issue
2. **Create New Issue**: Use template to create current session issue
3. **Update Status**: Mark previous session as completed
4. **Plan Work**: Prioritize tasks for current session

### During Session
1. **Update Progress**: Keep current issue updated
2. **Link Work**: Reference PRs, commits, and related issues
3. **Note Blockers**: Document any issues or dependencies

### End of Session
1. **Final Update**: Complete current session issue
2. **Prepare Next**: Note what to start with tomorrow
3. **Archive**: Move completed work to appropriate status

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always Start with Next Steps**: Check the current "Next Steps" issue before starting work
2. **Update Frequently**: Keep the issue updated throughout your session
3. **Link Everything**: Reference PRs, commits, and related issues
4. **Use Labels**: Consistent labeling helps with organization
5. **Close Completed**: Mark completed work appropriately
6. **Plan Ahead**: Always note what to start with next session

## 🎯 Example Session Start

1. **Open**: [Current Next Steps Issue](https://github.com/otherjamesbrown/TheTally/issues/19)
2. **Review**: What was completed and what's next
3. **Check**: Security scan status, PR status, any blockers
4. **Plan**: Prioritize tasks for current session
5. **Start**: Begin with highest priority item

This approach ensures you never lose track of where you are and can pick up exactly where you left off!
