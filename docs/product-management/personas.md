# User Personas

## Persona: "Looking to retire James"

**Age:** 53  
**Role:** Software Engineer  
**Goal:** Wants a clear, no-nonsense view of where his money is going without sharing his bank credentials directly. He's happy to download and upload a CSV once a month.

### User Stories:

**Account Setup:** As James, I want to create a secure account with 2FA so that I feel confident my financial data is safe.

**File Import:** As James, I want to upload a CSV file from my bank so that I can import all my monthly transactions into the application in one go.

**Categorization:** As James, I want the application to automatically categorize my transactions based on rules I define so that I don't have to manually label every expense.

**Rule Management:** As James, I want to create and edit my own categorization rules (e.g., map "TFL" to "Transport") so that the system accurately reflects my spending habits.

**Transaction View:** As James, I want to see a simple list of all my imported transactions with their categories so that I can review and understand my spending.
