## Project Boards

### üöÄ Sprint Board
Track current sprint work with columns:
- **Backlog** - Ready to work on
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Review** - Ready for code review
- **Testing** - In testing phase
- **Done** - Completed

### üéØ Roadmap Board
Track long-term planning with columns:
- **Ideas** - Future possibilities
- **Planned** - Scheduled for future sprints
- **In Progress** - Currently in development
- **Completed** - Delivered

### üêõ Bug Triage Board
Manage bug reports with columns:
- **New** - Just reported
- **Needs Info** - Waiting for more information
- **Confirmed** - Reproduced and confirmed
- **In Progress** - Being fixed
- **Fixed** - Ready for testing
- **Closed** - Resolved

## Workflow

### 1. Creating Issues
1. Choose the appropriate template
2. Fill out all required fields
3. Add relevant labels
4. Assign to appropriate milestone
5. Set priority and effort estimates

### 2. Triage Process
1. **New issues** are labeled `needs-triage`
2. Review and add appropriate labels
3. Assign priority and effort
4. Move to appropriate project board
5. Assign to team member if needed

### 3. Development Process
1. Move issue to "In Progress" when starting work
2. Create a branch named `issue-{number}-{description}`
3. Reference issue in commit messages: `Fixes #123`
4. Move to "Review" when PR is ready
5. Move to "Done" when merged and deployed

### 4. Closing Issues
- Use keywords in PR descriptions: `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, `Resolves #123`
- Add resolution comment explaining the fix
- Update labels and remove from active boards

## Best Practices

### For Issue Creators
- **Be specific** - Provide clear, detailed descriptions
- **Include context** - Explain the problem and desired outcome
- **Add labels** - Help with categorization and triage
- **Check duplicates** - Search existing issues first
- **Provide examples** - Include code snippets, screenshots, or steps

### For Issue Responders
- **Acknowledge quickly** - Respond within 24 hours
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Get the information you need
- **Update labels** - Keep categorization current
- **Set expectations** - Provide timeline estimates
- **Close when done** - Don't leave issues hanging

### For Maintainers
- **Regular triage** - Review new issues weekly
- **Update milestones** - Keep roadmap current
- **Monitor boards** - Ensure smooth workflow
- **Communicate changes** - Update issue status regularly

## Automation

### Auto-labeling
- Issues are automatically labeled based on templates
- PRs are automatically labeled based on changed files
- Milestones are automatically suggested based on content

### Notifications
- @mentions notify specific users
- Label changes trigger notifications
- Milestone updates send alerts
- Project board moves create activity

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the `/docs` folder first
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions
- **Security**: Use private security advisories for vulnerabilities
- **Contributing**: See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development guidelines
